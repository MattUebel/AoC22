# Day 7 - no_space_left_on_device

Spent a few hours on this while watching christmas movies. I tried iterating through the commands, got caught up on trying to make a sublist of the "output" of the `ls` command. Wasn't getting anywhere, started talking with ChatGPT about it, thought about creating a tree structure with a `Node` class that had a sum, children, and parent.

Sketched that out but ultimately didn't get any closer. Finally broke and checked out @dagonis's solution. Learned how important it is to only pay attention to the things that actually need paid attention to. I.e., you can just `pass` when you get to the `ls` part.

Checked out other solutions on the reddit thread. I could have gotten to the tree-based solution I think if I persisted enough with it, but it's not happening and I'm gonna lose out on some gold stars ðŸ˜…

Otherwise, made a script to scaffold the file structure for each day of AoC.
